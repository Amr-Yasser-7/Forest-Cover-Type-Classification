# Forest Cover Type Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project completed during my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**.  
The goal is to **predict the type of forest cover** for different areas of land based on ecological and environmental features such as elevation, soil type, and climate conditions.  

---

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Classify forest land plots into different cover types.  
- **Dataset**: [Forest Cover Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction)  
- **Approach**: Apply machine learning models to predict forest cover type from tabular data.

## Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Explored dataset structure and patterns.  
   - Visualized distributions of features like elevation, soil type, and slope.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled categorical and numerical features.  
   - Prepared the dataset for training.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Trained machine learning classification models.  
   - Tuned parameters to improve performance.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Measured model accuracy and performance.  
   - Compared results across different approaches.  

5. **Insights**  
   - Identified how natural features influence forest cover types.  
   - Highlighted potential applications for land management and sustainability.

## Results
- Achieved strong classification accuracy on the dataset.  
- Demonstrated that ecological patterns can be modeled effectively with ML.  
- Insights can support:  
  - Forest and land management decisions.  
  - Environmental sustainability projects.  
  - Data-driven ecological research.
